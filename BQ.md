# Step by step guide

## Intro

People skills become more important as an engineer becomes more senior. We should: lead and influence, resolve conflicts, anticipate risks, plan road map.

Hiring a engineer cannot work with others can ultimately be a net deficit for companies. They want person that will work well with the existing employees and help the team, and BQ is one way of determining whether someone will begood to work with from a non-tech standpoint.

Typically BQ can be split into several types:

1. Getting to know your career preferences, ambitions and plans;
2. Discuss details of experiences or projects written in the resume;
3. "Tell me about a time where you" type of questions where you describe how you demonstrated certain traits or responded to a situation.

## STAR format

STAR format helps you organize the answers, most applicable to questions requiring you to recount past experiences or behavior.

`situation`: Share details about the situation that gave rise to the task

`task`: Explain what you needed to achieve or the problems you had to solve, focusing on:
`scope`; `severity`; `specific benchmarks/outcomes required`

`Action`: Explain what you did to meet your objectives, options you had and how you made the decisions/

`Result`: Describe the outcome of your actions and what you learned

# What is the evaluation system?

BQ has a lot more variance in terms of evaluation criteria, while most top tech companies use the company values to evaluate by filling a section evaluating how a candidate has displayed behaviors in line with company values. Thus, you should search up a company's culture and values and ensure you embody them within the answer.

1. `Motivation`: what drives you?
   Ideal candidates are self-motivated, passionate about tech and products that have a real impact.
2. `Ability to be proactive`: Are you able to take initiative?
   Given a difficult problem, are you able to figure out how to get it done and execute on it?
3. `Perseverance`: Are you able to push through difficult problems or blockers?
4. `Conflict Resolution`: How well are you able to handle and work through challenging relationships?
5. `Empathy`: How well are you able to see things from the perspective of others and understand your motivations?
6. `Growth`: How well do you unnderstand your strength, weaknesses and growth areas? Are you making a continued effort to grow?
