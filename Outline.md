## Intro

Usually consists of multiple rounds: coding, system design, behaviorial, lasting for hours.

## Study for coding interview

Leetcode.

The recommended time period to set aside for coding interview is 3 months, 11h/week, total up to 150h or so. [study plan](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/)

## Study for System Design interview

If you are a mid or senior-level candidate, you may expect system design questions as part of your technical interview. They aren't covered adequately by LeetCode and good resources are still harder to come by.

The objective of system design interviews is to evaluate a candidate's skill at designing real-world software systems involving multiple components.

## Study for behavioral interview

Typically, behavioral interviews for software engineers include: Sharing about details of previous experiences on resume Providing examples of past situations and behavior that demonstrate certain behavioral attributes (e.g. conflict management, data driven) Sharing of ambitions and career plans.

### STAR format

STAR format helps you organize the answers, most applicable to questions requiring you to recount past experiences or behavior.

`situation`: Share details about the situation that gave rise to the task

`task`: Explain what you needed to achieve or the problems you had to solve, focusing on:
`scope`; `severity`; `specific benchmarks/outcomes required`

`Action`: Explain what you did to meet your objectives, options you had and how you made the decisions/

`Result`: Describe the outcome of your actions and what you learned
